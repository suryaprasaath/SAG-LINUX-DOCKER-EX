Linux & Bash Scripting Exercises


1. Create a file named file.txt, and create a user sample user. Change the ownership of the file to sampleuser.


adduser suser
touch file.txt
chown suser file.txt
chgrp suser file.txt 


2. Switch to sample user in terminal then change the permission of the file.txt to the user and group as rwx


sudo su suser
chmod +rwx file.txt


3. Increase the open file limit


cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
sysctl -w fs.file-max=400000
  



4. Increase the swapsize by adding new swap storage


dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile1 bs=1024 count=524288
chmod  600 /swapfile1
mkswap /swapfile1
Swapon /swapfile1
  



5.Remove the swap storage


swapoff -v /swapfile1
rm /swapfile1


To check use => swapon -s
  

6. Write an script that will read the file content.txt that contains the names,age,job title and print the       
value in this order “name(age) – jobtitle”
Contents.txt file contents
Raj 30 Developer
Ram 25 Ops
Gokul 21 Intern
Sundar 45 CEO
Anil 38 SRE
                Output example
                            Raj(30) – Developer


touch content.txt
awk '{print $1,"("$2")","- " $3}' content.txt




7. Write an script that will get the company name as arguments(command line arguments) and print their products by parsing the following json file
{
“Ibm”: [“RedHat”,”Mainframe”,”IBM cloud”,”RHEL”],
“google”: [“k8s”,”kaggle”,”firebase”],
“microsoft”: [“windows”,”azure”,”office365”],
“amazon”: [“AWS”,”AWS Gov”,”Amplify”],
“softwareag”: [“webmethods”,”AIRS”,”ADABAS”,”CumIOT”]
}
Step 1: touch pro.txt
Step 2: In product-script.sh
 
echo `jq ‘.’$1’’ pro.json`


Step 3: Execute the script and give an input as an argument 
sh product-script.sh amazon


8. Create an script that will calculate the sum of prime numbers between 0 to an given number(to be given as an argument) name it child.sh, create another script named parent.sh which check if the child script exists in current dir and if exists change permission to execute for current user and call the child script from the parent script passing the number as argument
 
Child.sh


#!/bin/bash
#Author : Surya
#Description : Sum of n Prime numbers
#Creation date : 17-06-2022


for((i=2; i<=$1; i++))
do
 for  ((j=2; j<=$(($i/2)); j++))
 do
  if [ $(($i % $j)) -eq 0 ]
   then
    j=$i
   break
  fi
 done
 if [ $j -ne  $i ]
  then
  sum=$(($sum + $i))
 Fi 
done
echo "Sum is $(($sum+2))"






Parent.sh


#!/bin/bash
#Author : Surya
#Description : Script to check if file exists or not.
#Creation date : 17-06-2022


if [ -e 'child.sh' ]
then
  chmod a+x child.sh
  sh child.sh $1
else
 echo File not exit
fi


9. Install the apache httpd server(centos preferred), and the home page should say “SoftwareAG”


sudo yum update httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd


Next step is to edit the index.html file in the /var/www/html directory to display SoftwareAG


  





10. Make the Https server an Linux systemd service and write an script to stop, start and restart the server via systemctl


Create a service file in /etc/systemd/system/ directory


[Unit]
Description=Http Server


[Service]
User=surya
ExecStart=/home/surya/Desktop/linuxex/http-server.sh
Restart=always






Script to start stop and restart the server


#!/bin/bash


echo Enter your choice
echo "1)Start server"
echo "2)Stop server"
echo "3)Restart server"
echo "4)Server status"


read choice


case $choice in


 1) sudo systemctl start http-server.service;;
 2) sudo systemctl stop http-server.service;;
 3) sudo systemctl restart http-server.service;;
 4) sudo systemctl status http-server.service;;
